# mysqldump archive

This is a lambda script that is designed to run when new files are `PUT`
into a S3 bucket.  Oldest file is put in a seperate S3 bucket location.

## This repository is no longer maintained

S3 replication was made possible directly through the interface and this script is now deprecated.
